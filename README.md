**laser — Likelihood Analysis of Speciation/Extinction Rates from Phylogenies** 
is an R package used for many years to evaluate diversification models. It is no longer on CRAN (as CRAN's requirements change, old packages are thrown off unless updated to match the new rules) but for the sake of reproducibility I want to keep it easily available. To install it from here, do:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bomeara/laser")
```

To cite package ‘laser’ in publications use:

  Dan Rabosky and Klaus Schliep (2013). laser: Likelihood Analysis of
  Speciation/Extinction Rates from Phylogenies. R package version 2.4-1.
  https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=laser

A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is

```
  @Manual{,
    title = {laser: Likelihood Analysis of Speciation/Extinction Rates from
Phylogenies},
    author = {Dan Rabosky and Klaus Schliep},
    year = {2013},
    note = {R package version 2.4-1},
    url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=laser},
  }
```

And also be sure to cite the papers describing the methods you use from within the package. Citations are the currency with which we pay the people who have done the work making our work possible.
